# RL4Rec_papers

This list is one of the most complete collection for papers about RL based recommender system, and  it especilly focuses on actual engineering experience from companies .

I do believe a RL based recommender system is trustworthy **if and only if the online A/B tests have been conducted** (They usually comes from companies), so I marked these papers' title in bold.

Notes: This repo is similar to [@cszhangzhen's repo](https://github.com/cszhangzhen/DRL4Recsys),  but pays more attention to the works already tested in real-world senario.
